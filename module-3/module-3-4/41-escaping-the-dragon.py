"""Escaping the Dragon's Cave  
-------------------------  
Description:  
    You are trapped in a dragonâ€™s cave.  
    You must type the command "run" exactly 3 times in a row to escape.  
    Use a `while` loop and a counter to track correct commands.

Expected Input (from user):  
    Type your action: hide  
    Type your action: run  
    Type your action: run  
    Type your action: run  

Expected Output:  
    You escape the cave safely!

Tasks  
    1. Create a variable called `run_count` and set it to 0  
    2. Use a `while` loop that runs while `run_count` is less than 3  
    3. Inside the loop, ask the user to "Type your action: "  
    4. If the input is "run", increase `run_count` by 1  
    5. If the input is anything else, print "That won't help!"  
    6. After the loop, print "You escape the cave safely!"
