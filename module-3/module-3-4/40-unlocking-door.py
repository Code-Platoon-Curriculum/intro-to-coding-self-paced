"""Unlocking a Magic Door  
-------------------------  
Description:  
    You are standing in front of a sealed magic door.  
    It will only open if the correct password is spoken.  
    Use a `while` loop to keep asking the user to enter the password until they get it right.  
    The correct password is: "open"

Expected Input (from user):  
    Enter password: wrong  
    Enter password: swordfish  
    Enter password: open  

Expected Output:  
    The door unlocks with a flash of light.

Tasks  
    1. Create a variable called `guess` and set it to an empty string  
    2. Use a `while` loop to keep running until `guess` equals "open"  
    3. Inside the loop, use `input()` to ask: "Enter password: "  
    4. When the correct password is entered, print "The door unlocks with a flash of light."
