-------------------------  
Description:  
    Create a program that checks whether a player's attack hits the enemy.

    meets or exceeds the enemy's Armor Class (AC).  

Expected Input:  
    Attack Roll: 17  
    Enemy Armor Class (AC): 15  

Expected Output:  
    "Hit!"

Tasks  
    1. Create a variable called `attack_roll` and assign it an Integer
    2. Create another variable called `armor_class` and assign it an Integer  
    3. Use an `if` statement to check if the attack roll is greater than or equal to the armor class  
    4. If it is, print "Hit!"
