"""Enemy Threat Assessment  
-------------------------  
Description:  
    Create a program that checks the threat level of an enemy based on their level.  
    Use an `if`, `elif`, and `else` statement to categorize the threat:  
        - Level 1–3: "Minor threat"  
        - Level 4–6: "Moderate threat"  
        - Level 7 and above: "Severe threat"  

Expected Input:  
    Enemy Level: 5  

Expected Output:  
    "Moderate threat"

Tasks  
    1. Create a variable called `enemy_level` and assign it an Integer  
    2. Use an `if` statement to check if the level is 3 or below — if so, print "Minor threat"  
    3. Use an `elif` statement to check if the level is between 4 and 6 — if so, print "Moderate threat"  
    4. Use an `else` statement to catch all other levels — print "Severe threat"
