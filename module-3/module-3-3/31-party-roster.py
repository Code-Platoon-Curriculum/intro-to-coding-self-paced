"""Party Roster Display  
-------------------------  
Description:  
    Create a program that loops through a list of adventurer names and prints them out one by one.  
    Use a `for` loop to display each party member.  

    NOTICE: We are using a Data Structure we haven't covered, Lists. For now, just understand it
    is a group of multiple values of the same or different data type. Lists are ordered by Index, meaning 
    the first item in the list is at position Index 0, the second item is in position Index 1, and 
    etc. Lists allow us to create variables with more values than 1.
    
Expected Input (predefined list):  
    party = ["Elora", "Thorn", "Gimli", "Luna"]

Expected Output:  
    Adventurer: Elora  
    Adventurer: Thorn  
    Adventurer: Gimli  
    Adventurer: Luna  

Tasks  
    1. Create a list of names called `party` 
    2. Use a `for` loop to go through each name in the list  
    3. Print each name using the format: "Adventurer: <name>" by using the f string
