"""Repeating a Spell Chant  
-------------------------  
Description:  
    A wizard must repeat a simple chant 3 times to cast a protection spell.  
    Use a `while` loop to print the chant message until it has been said 3 times.

Expected Output:  
    Chanting...  
    Chanting...  
    Chanting...  

Tasks  
    1. Create a variable called `count` and set it to 0  
    2. Use a `while` loop that runs as long as `count` is less than 3  
    3. Inside the loop, print "Chanting..."  
    4. Increase the `count` by 1 each time the loop runs
