"""Potion Mixing Timer  
-------------------------  
Description:  
    An alchemist must stir a potion every second for 4 seconds.  
    Use a `while` loop to simulate the timer and print a message for each second.

Expected Output:  
    Stirring... 1 second  
    Stirring... 2 seconds  
    Stirring... 3 seconds  
    Stirring... 4 seconds  
    Potion ready!

Tasks  
    1. Create a variable called `time` and set it to 1  
    2. Use a `while` loop that runs while `time` is less than or equal to 4  
    3. Print "Stirring..." and the current time 
    4. Increase `time` by 1 each loop  
    5. After the loop, print "Potion ready!"
