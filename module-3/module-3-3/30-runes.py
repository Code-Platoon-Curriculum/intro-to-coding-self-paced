"""Reading the Rune  
-------------------------  
Description:  
    You have found a glowing rune stone with a short magical word carved into it.  
    Use a `for` loop to look at each character in the rune and print it one by one.  
    This helps the wizard read the rune out loud for activation.

Expected Input (predefined string):  
    rune = "fire"

Expected Output:  
    Reading rune: f  
    Reading rune: i  
    Reading rune: r  
    Reading rune: e

Tasks  
    1. Create a variable called `rune` and assign it a short string like "fire"  
    2. Use a `for` loop to go through each character in the string  
    3. Print each character using the format: "Reading rune: <character>"
