"""Alchemy Ingredient Checker  
-------------------------  
Description:  
    You're helping an alchemist mix a potion.  
    The potion recipe requires checking the name of the ingredient and the quantity provided.  
    Use `input()` to collect both values.  
    Use **string methods** (like `.lower()` or `.strip()`) to clean the input, and **arithmetic** to check the quantity.  
    Use `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements to decide if the potion can be made.  

Potion Logic:  
    - If the ingredient is "mandrake" and the amount is 3 or more, print "Potion brewing..."  
    - Elif the ingredient is "nightshade" and the amount is exactly 1, print "Handle with care..."  
    - Elif the ingredient is "dragon root", regardless of amount, print "Rare find! Begin preparation."  
    - Else, print "Invalid ingredient or incorrect amount."  

Expected Input (from user):  
    Enter ingredient:  Dragon Root  
    Enter amount: 2  

Expected Output:  
    "Rare find! Begin preparation."

Tasks  
    1. Use `input()` to get the ingredient name and quantity from the user  
    2. Clean the ingredient string using `.lower()` and `.strip()`  
    3. Convert the quantity to an integer  
    4. Use `if`, `elif`, and `else` to check conditions based on the cleaned name and amount  
    5. Print the appropriate result based on the logic
