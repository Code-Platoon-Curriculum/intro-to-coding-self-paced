"""Magic Door Password Check  
-------------------------  
Description:  
    A player encounters a magical door that requires a secret password to open.  
    Write a program that checks the player's input against a set of known magical words.  
    Use `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements with the `==` operator to decide what happens.  

Password Logic:  
    - If the password is "OpenSesame", the door opens.  
    - If the password is "Friend", the door opens silently.  
    - If the password is "Swordfish", the door opens but triggers a trap.  
    - If the password is anything else, the door stays shut.

Expected Input:  
    Password: "Friend"  

Expected Output:  
    "The door opens silently."

Tasks  
    1. Create a variable called `password` and assign it the input from the user
    2. Use `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements to compare the password to known phrases  
    3. Print the appropriate message based on the password
