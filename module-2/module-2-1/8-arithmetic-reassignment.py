"""Basic Arithmetic Variable Reassignment
---------------------------
Description:
    Create a program that demonstrates variable reassignment through basic arithmetic operations.
    The program should ask the user for a starting number, perform a series of arithmetic
    operations on that number (reassigning the result back to the same variable each time),
    and display the value after each operation.

Example Input:
    Enter a starting number: 10

Example Output:
    Starting value: 10.0
    After adding 5: 15.0
    After subtracting 3: 12.0
    After multiplying by 2: 24.0
    After dividing by 4: 6.0

Tasks:
    1. Create a variable to store the user's starting number (convert input to float)
    2. Display the starting value
    3. Add 5 to the variable and reassign the result back to the same variable
    4. Display the new value
    5. Subtract 3 from the variable and reassign the result
    6. Display the new value
    7. Multiply the variable by 2 and reassign the result
    8. Display the new value
    9. Divide the variable by 4 and reassign the result
    10. Display the final value
