"""String Indexing with Word Extraction  
-------------------------  
Description:  
    Create a program that demonstrates string indexing using a sentence. The program uses a predefined sentence
    and asks the user to extract specific words using indexing. These words are then combined to form a meaningful phrase.

Expected Input: 
    "Well, I truly love pancakes, yet the python escaped."

Expected Output:
    word1: I  
    word2: love  
    word3: python  
    Combined sentence: I love python

Tasks
    1. Use indexing to extract the following words:
        - "I" 
        - "love"
        - "python"
    2. Store each of these words in their own variables: `word1`, `word2`, and `word3`.
    3. Concatenate these words with spaces in between to form a new string: `"I love python" into a new variable.
    4. Display the final sentence.
