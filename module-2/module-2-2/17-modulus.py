"""Modulus
------------- 
Description:  
    Create a program that checks if a number is even or odd using the modulus operator. The Modulus operator is at its
    core just simple division, but instead it returns what is remaining AFTER the division. It is often called the "Remainder" 
    operator.

Expected Input:
    num1 = 17
    num2 = 16

Expected Output:
    remainder1 = 1
    remainder2 = 0

Tasks:
    1. Create two different variables one that is not even and one that is.
    2. Use the modulus operator `%` to determine if the number is divisible by 2 assigning it to their own variable.
    3. Display both results to see the difference between an odd and an even number.
