"""Integer to String Conversion
---------------
Description:  
    This problem demonstrates how to convert an integer to a string so it can be used in concatenation.

Expected Input:
    Integer variable: 25
    String input from user: "Alice"

Expected Output:
    Final message = "Hi Alice, you are 25 years old"

Tasks:
    1. Create a variable called `age` and assign it the integer value of your choice.
    2. Ask the user for their name using the `input()` function and store it in a variable called `name`.
    3. Convert the `age` variable to a string using `str()`.
    4. Concatenate the `name` and `age` into a full sentence like: "Hi [name], you are [age] years old."
    5. Display the final message.

Example:
    Input: name = "Alice"  
    Output: Hi Alice, you are 25 years old.
